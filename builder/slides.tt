<em>The art of growing a Perl project</em>
</p>

===

<h2>Motivations</h2>

<p>Running a successful open-source project will teach  you <b>a lot</b></p>

===

	<p>New eyes on your project :<br/>
	constant code-review</p>

===

	<p>Feedback means better code</p>

===

	<p>Fresh ideas and constant motivation</p>

===

	<p>Contributions<br/>
	a goldmine of positive energy</p>

===

<h2>The best reward</h2>

<p>People will use your software</p>

===

<h2>Even better</h2>

<p>Some of them will help you<br>
make it better</p>

===

<h2>Wait, <em>Software</em>, we said.</h2>

===

<h1>Programming<br>

vs<br>

Software </h1>

===

<h2>Programming</h2>

<img src="/images/rubixcube.jpg" />

===

<h2>Programming is Easy</h2>

===

	<p>It's just about knowing<br />
	well your language</p>

===

	<p>A matter of time and motivation</p>

===

<img src="/images/rubixcube-practice.jpg" />

	<p>practice, learn and try</p>

===

<img src="/images/rubixcube-master.jpg">

	<p>eventually, anyone can <br>
	master a programming language</p>

===
	<em>because it's <b>one-dimensional</b></em>

<h1>Software Development</h1>


===

<img src="/images/goban.jpg">

<h2>It's hard</h2>

===

<p>it's not just about lines of code</p>

===

<img src="/images/bug.jpg" />

<h2>Bugs</h2>

===

<img src="/images/users.jpg" align="left" vspace="5"/>

<h2 class="middle">Users</h2>

===

<img src="/images/contributors.jpg" align="center" vspace="5" />

<h2>Contributors</h2>

<h2>Backward compatibilty</h2>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

===

<img src="/images/troll.jpg">

<h2>Sometimes, even<br>
some trolls ;)</h2>

===

<p>
And many other things<br />
you don't controll
</p>

===

<p>Well, it's hard because<br />
it's <em>multi-dimensional</em></p>

===

<img src="/images/crowd.jpg">

<p>You're not alone anymore</p>

===

<img src="/images/taichi.jpg" />

<p>
Handling this flow
<br>
is difficult
</p>

===

<h2>Advices to the project maintainer</h2>

===

<h3>Do not expect for perfection </h3>

===

<img src="/images/sagrada.jpg" />

<p>Expecting perfection<br />
means never releasing</p>

===

<h3>Focus on what your project does </h3>

===

<img src="/images/focus.jpg" align="left" />

<p class="middle">
Don't start many things at once,
focus on your main track
</p>

===

<h3>Move forward slowly</h3>

===

<img src="/images/bigjump.jpg" />

<p>big jumps are risky</p>

===

<p>
And of course, take very seriously
<br>
your ongrowing community
</p>

===

<h1>Community Building</h1>

===

<p>Everything starts with your code</p>

===

<img src="/images/github.png" />

<h2>GitHub</h2>

===

It has to be on GitHub, period :)

===

Watchers

===

Forks

===

Pull Requests

===

Web interface over Git

===

It's a <em>major</em> helper

===

<h1>Test::More</h1>

<p>
You want to write a good test suite
</p>

===

<p>More tests, less bugs.</p>

<p>
It's as simple as that.
</p>

===

Code quality directly <br />depends on your test-suite

===
<h2>Devel::Cover</h2>

Aim a very high code coverage

===

<p>
<em>« If it's not covered, it's broken. Every. Single. Time. »</em>
</p>

<p>
-- <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/03/100-test-coverage.html">Ovid</a>
</p>

===

<h1>Release</h1>

<p>
Once you feel good with your code,<br>
it's time to release
</p>

===

Release Early.

===

Release Early, Release often.

===

<p>
<em>Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.</em>
</p>

<p>

</p>

===

The more you listen to your users,
the better your software will be.

===

Software is made for users, <br/>
not the opposite.

===

<h1>Users</h1>

<p>
First of all, thank them.
</p>

===

<p>Take seriously any kind <br/>
of remark they can make</p>

===

Maybe they're facing a <br/>
situation you didn't expect

===

Or maybe, it's just<br>
your crappy code ;)

===

Any bug report is a bit of love <br>
for your project, remember that.

===

<h1>Contributors</h1>

===

<p>
Contributors are super-users
</p>

===

<p>
Not only they've used your software<br>
but they've started working on it.
</p>

===

They are your best allies. <br>
Thank them twice, and listen to them.

===

<h2>Egalitarianism</h2>

===

<h2>Meritocracy</h2>

===

<p>Eventually, <br/>
some contributors will rise.</p>

===

They are regular helpers,<br>
and well-skilled.

===

Reward them with a commit-bit<br>
to your repo.

===

Egalitarianism, again.

===

Don't fear the project<br>
to take its own life.

===

<p>
Keep your vision in mind
</p>

===

But let the project evolves

===
